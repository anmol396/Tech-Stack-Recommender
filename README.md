A Python-based recommendation engine that analyzes user skills and suggests suitable technology career paths using similarity-based scoring techniques.

The project combines **TF-IDF**, **Cosine Similarity**, and **Skill Coverage** to generate personalized recommendations, learning paths, and career insights.

---

# Project Overview

This project helps users:

* Discover matching technology career paths
* Understand current skill readiness
* Identify missing skills
* Receive personalized learning guidance
* Visualize recommendation results

---

# Key Highlights

✔ Skill-based recommendation engine
✔ TF-IDF vectorization
✔ Cosine similarity ranking
✔ Skill coverage scoring
✔ Career recommendation logic
✔ Graph generation and analysis
✔ Beginner-friendly implementation

# Recommendation Method

### Formula

```text
Final Score =
(0.7 × Cosine Similarity)
+
(0.3 × Skill Coverage)
```

| Component                  | Weight | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------------- | -----: | --------------------------------------- |
| TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity |    70% | Calculates similarity between skills    |
| Skill Coverage             |    30% | Calculates percentage of matched skills |
